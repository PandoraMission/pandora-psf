    "## Updating with new optical models from LLNL\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have new optical PSF models for the NIR and Visible channel these are usually matlab grids of PSFs as a function of position and wavelength. To update these follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build new fits files\n",
    "\n",
    "The matlab files need to be converted into fits files. Use the function\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hdulist = pandorapsf.utils.make_PSF_fits_files(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which will return the fits file format for `pandorapsf`. Look at the docstring for that function to find out how to process the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update the expected file dates in the configuration file for `pandorapsf` \n",
    "\n",
    "The config file in `pandorapsf`'s `__init__` file has a set of dates, e.g. \n",
    "```\n",
    "        \"vis_psf_creation_date\": \"2025-03-28T10:30:27.329441\",\n",

    "You need to update these to the new dates of your file. Once updated, reload the package and run \"reset_config\" to update your config to the new default. \n",

    "### Upload the files to zenodo\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to go to the zenodo listing for the Pandora models, click new version, and then upload the new files. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Update the zenodo link in the configuration file for `pandorapsf` \n",
    "\n",
    "In the config file there is a link to Zenodo, e.g.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Build the low resolution fallback files\n",
    "\n",
    "We store a very small version of these files as a fallback within the package directory. This is so that a single PSF can be evaluated if the package is pip installed without ever downloading the full grid files. Run\n",
